# Wordle Clone
This wordle has two variants of the game. One way is to use the Graphical User Interface, which is designed to look similar to the original Wordle game. The second way is to use the Command Line Interface.


## Model-View-Controller pattern 
MVC was used as it allows the application to be broken into three main components, Model, View and Controller. This Pattern minimises repeated code and allows both GUI and CLI versions of the game to use the same model.
